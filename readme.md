A bot for my Twitch chat. Is a good boy when he wants to be.

Features:
- Fun commands (whoop, bff, trivia, 8ball, etc.)
- Other commands (discord, youtube, shoutout)
- Timers (for posting discord & youtube)
- Custom channel point rewards for causing visual effects, playing sound effects, and more
- Stores chat logs & stream stats to .txt files so I can reference them later

Planned features:
- Toggle game-specific rewards based on game/tags
- Utility commands (update title/game/tags, uptime)
- Pokemon command to catch random pokemon once a day? (would use PokeAPI)
- Twitch Plays (reward for pressing user-specified input)
