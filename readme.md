[WIP]

A bot for my Twitch chat. Is a good boy when he wants to be.

Features:
- Fun commands (whoop, bff, trivia, 8ball, etc.)
- Other commands (discord, youtube, shoutout)
- Timers (for posting discord & youtube)
- Custom channel point rewards for causing visual effects, playing sound effects, and more
- Stores chat logs & stream stats to .txt files so I can reference them later

Planned features:
- Toggle game-specific rewards based on game/tags
- Utility commands (update title/game/tags, uptime)
- Pokemon command to catch random pokemon once a day? (would use PokeAPI)
- Twitch Plays (reward for pressing user-specified input)


Open source to act as an example for those learning how to use TwitchLib or how to make a Twitch bot. Anyone's welcome to add Howard to their channel (you'll need to create your own `.env` file and change some things (documentation for this will come when I'm more done with the project), all I ask is you credit me in bio or in a bot timer command and link to this original repo. But while it's in WIP state I obviously wouldn't recommend adding this bot to your channel.
