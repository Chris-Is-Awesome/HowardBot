A bot for my Twitch chat. Is a good boy when he wants to be.

Features:
- Fun commands (whoop, bff, trivia, etc.)
- Other commands (discord, youtube, shoutout)
- Timers (for posting discord & youtube)
- Custom channel point rewards for cusing visual effects

Planned features:
- Toggle game-specific rewards based on game/tags
- Utility commands (update title/game/tags, uptime)
- 8ball command?
- Pokemon command to catch random pokemon once a day? (would use PokeAPI)
- Twitch Plays (reward for pressing user-specified input)
- Store chat logs to .txt files so I can reference them later
